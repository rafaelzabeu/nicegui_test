Just playing around with nicegui, this project does not do anything :D

# How to run

Install the dependecies with

```
poetry install
```

activate the env with

```
poetry shell
```

and then start the server with

```
python nicegui_test/__main__.py
```

The page will be on http://localhost:8080/
